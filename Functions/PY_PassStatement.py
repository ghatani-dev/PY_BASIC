"""
The pass statement in Python is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes.
It is syntactically required but you do not want any command or code to execute.

# Example 1: Using pass in a function
def my_function():
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
my_function()  # This will do nothing


# Example 2: Using pass in a loop
for i in range(5):
    pass  # Loop does nothing
print("Loop completed")  # This will print after the loop


# Example 3: Using pass in a conditional statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")

# Example 4: Using pass in a class definition
class MyClass:
    pass  # Placeholder for future class implementation
obj = MyClass()  # Creating an instance of MyClass
print("Instance of MyClass created")  # This will print after creating the instance

# Example 5: Using pass in exception handling
try:
    1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    pass  # Ignore the exception
print("Exception handled")  # This will print after handling the exception

# Example 6: Using pass in nested structures
def outer_function():
    def inner_function():
        pass  # Placeholder for future code in inner function
    inner_function()  # Call to inner function
outer_function()  # Call to outer function
print("Outer function executed")  # This will print after executing the outer function

# Example 7: Using pass in a while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    count += 1
    pass  # Loop does nothing
print("While loop completed")  # This will print after the loop

# Example 8: Using pass in a try-except-finally block
try:
    x = int("not a number")  # This will raise a ValueError
except ValueError:
    pass  # Ignore the exception    
finally:
    print("Finally block executed")  # This will always print
